Code for a 2D RTS WebGL game I made last year. This is just code for the game in Unity. The website code is in the .zip file (yeah, should've made a second repo for it). 


It was hosted on a site with cloud services before but didn't set up any security measures for DDoS attacks then and didn't want to bother with that possibility so I took it down.


My inspo was Stronghold 2001. I'm bad at drawing assets so it doesn't look the best (at one point hired freelancers to draw some things but it just didn't fit the style so I scrapped it). 


### The gameplay
You figure out the mechanics of selling wood and buying weapons and troops. You notice some odd looking NPCs (enemies) in the bottom left corner of your castle. After slaying them you notice new enemies heading towards your castle every once in a while from the bottom right, as you explore that area you find out an enemy base. Eventually you kill its leader and the enemy spawner. Then you unlock a new building in your castle for summoning a stronger type of troop, and you use that to kill the final boss at the top of the map (that you eventually notice from exploring the map). A little lame but looked cool at the time :)


Here are some screenshots:

### The previous iteration of the game
I tried making an RTS before this, two years ago, with the main inspiration being Stronghold Legends (basically this but 3D). I have a download link and a trailer saved:

I eventually plan on making something out of this game. Like making it actually good :)
